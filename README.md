# Super kawaii maximization project 💸 
# How to run: 
  download the zip and make sure the input cases are included in the zip file.  There are going to be two python files because of the two different approaches.  You can run 'dynamic.py' or 'exhaustive.py' in any order on any code compiler.  Once the file runs, it sould create a txt file for all the outputs which includes the maximization value and its index's.
